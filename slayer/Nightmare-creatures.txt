__Method__
⬥ Nightmares have two forms of attacks, a weaker melee auto-attack, and a ranged special attack which can deal large amounts of damage in 2 hits. Due to this, when killing nightmares it is recommended to pray <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> if benefitting from a form of healing such as a Scrimshaw of Vampyrism <:VampScrim:513201294262009874> or Blood spells from the Ancient spellbook.
⬥Both melee and magic can be used to kill Nightmares optimally, and the strategy between the styles does not change. Place your cannon at the spot shown in the image below, and stand next to the large pillar with <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> and auto-retaliate on. Melee suffers from a lower hitchance than magic, therefore an aura such as <:brawler:643505376917979138> could be used. 
⬥Magic is used via Legacy mode, as the healing offered from Blood spells is extremely strong, alongside hard hitting auto-attacks. Due to the nature of the Inquisitor's staff, the spell Blood Burst can be used for a small damage reduction whilst saving a large amount of blood runes, which one could do to improve profits. Due to Nightmare Creatures' high accuracy, they can deal large amounts of damage in short periods of time, so higher tiered armour or even tank armour should be used when maging in legacy, to mitigate the damage taken.

⬥Place the cannon on the red square, and stand on the yellow square after loading it with cannonballs. The player may have a chance to be walked backwards one square if they attack a Nightmare that is running towards them, in this case simply click back onto the highlighted square.
